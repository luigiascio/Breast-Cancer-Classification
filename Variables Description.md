# Variables Description
1.mean radius: The average radius of tumor cells.  
2.mean texture: The average texture of tumor cells.  
3.mean perimeter: The average perimeter of tumor cells.  
4.mean area: The average area of tumor cells.  
5.mean smoothness: The average smoothness of tumor cells.  
6.mean compactness: The average compactness of tumor cells.  
7.mean concavity: The average concavity of tumor cells.  
8.mean concave points: The average number of concave points in tumor cells.  
9.mean symmetry: The average symmetry of tumor cells.  
10.mean fractal dimension: The average fractal dimension of tumor cells.  
The first ten "mean" variables appear to represent various characteristics of tumor cells derived from images.  
  
11.radius error: The error associated with the radius of tumor cells.  
12.texture error: The error associated with the texture of tumor cells.  
13.perimeter error: The error associated with the perimeter of tumor cells.  
14.area error: The error associated with the area of tumor cells.  
15.smoothness error: The error associated with the smoothness of tumor cells.  
16.compactness error: The error associated with the compactness of tumor cells.  
17.concavity error: The error associated with the concavity of tumor cells.  
18.concave points error: The error associated with the number of concave points in tumor cells.  
19.symmetry error: The error associated with the symmetry of tumor cells.  
20.fractal dimension error: The error associated with the fractal dimension of tumor cells.  
These ten variables represent errors associated with measurements of cell characteristics.  

21-30. worst radius, worst texture, worst perimeter, ..., worst fractal dimension: These variables represent the "worst" values associated with tumor cells, indicating the most negative or extreme characteristics.  

label: The target variable, with binary values (0 or 1), indicating whether the tumor cell is malignant (0) or benign (1).
